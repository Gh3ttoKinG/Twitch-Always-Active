# Twitch-Always-Active
Twitch is probably just using the Visibility API since the `window.focus` & `window.blur` also tiggers when you are just in the browser menu or address bar.

So this stops triggering the `visibilitychange` event on the `document` level and makes Twitch believe it's always in the foreground.


Javascript version of https://openuserjs.org/scripts/lp0101/Always_Focused_Twitch/ \n

You can run it as a UserScript from the source above with a browser extension like TamperMonkey or use this version as a bookmark and click it on each stream tab.
